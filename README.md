# Emotion Predication

These are the set of scripts and notebooks used for our emotion prediction paper. 

# Guide
    - Copy trial_data_split-anon.zip into the RAW_EEG folder and unzip (RAW_EEG/p1 RAW_EEG/p2 etc should be visible)
    - From the src directory run python3 main.py or python main.py on non unix machines. This will create the csv files for each subject and will take some time since the dataset is large (~5GB)
    - The csv files used for training are located in 'ALIGEND_DATA' by default

Usage:
- The notebooks are for testing/prototyping
- The scripts create the .csv files by running the models
